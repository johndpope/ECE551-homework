\section{Python Exercise: Image Scaling with Separable Filters}\label{sec:p7}

Figure \ref{fig:p7} shows the results of the four pre-filters. Since the visual difference is subtle, their corresponding MSEs are included. Method (a) and (c) are actually the same since $h = \delta$ so their MSEs are the same (MSE = 209.9389). The pattern (around leg and scarf area) of method (b) is overly smoothed while the alias effect of (a) and (c) is clearly visible; therefore its MSE is much higher (MSE = 147068.8310). Method (d) is uses the optimal filter so it has the lowest MSE (MSE = 178.7584).
