The signal is approximated using LMS algorithm. To find the best $L$, the script runs through multiple $L$'s and choose the one with the lowest MSE. The script also has regularization to avoid divergence, where $\lambda$ is selected among $\{1, 1^{-1}, ..., 1^{-9}\}$ by the lowest MSE. The result is showed in Figure \ref{fig:p6}, where the optimal setting is $L=1$ giving $w \approx 0.9514$ and $MSE \approx 0.0540$
